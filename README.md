Nougat Pager Indicator
==========================

Nougat Pager Indicator is a simple library which ports pager indicator from notification tray which 
first appeared on Android N.

![Pager Indicator Sample][1]

It can be directly used with `ViewPager` or you can control it on your own. For sample usage, head
to `sample/` folder.


Getting started
---------------

  Include dependency into your project.
  
    compile 'io.github.mroczis:nougatpagerindicator:1.0.0'
    
    
  It is available on `jcenter`, so do not forget to link it in your root `build.gradle`.
  
    allprojects {
        repositories {
            jcenter()
        }
    }

  Add `PagerIndicator` to XML anywhere you like.

    <cz.mroczis.nougatpagerindicator.PagerIndicator
        android:id="@+id/indicator"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:npiActiveDot="1"
        app:npiActiveDotColor="@color/colorOrange"
        app:npiInactiveDotColor="@color/colorGray"
        app:npiDotRadius="3dp"
        app:npiDotSpacing="6dp"
        app:npiDotsCount="5"
        />

  Attach `PagerIndicator` to instance of your `ViewPager`

    final PagerIndicator indicator = findViewById(R.id.indicator);
    final ViewPager pager = findViewById(R.id.pager);
    
    indicator.setupWithViewPager(pager);
